                COVID‚Äë19 is the new respiratory disease spreading around the world and
                it is caused by a coronavirus. COVID‚Äë19 is short for ‚Äúcoronavirus
                disease 2019.‚Äù

                <li class="list2">
                    The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in
                    close contact with one another (about 6 feet) and through
                    respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or
                    sneezes.

                    People are most contagious when they are the sickest. But those who
                    don‚Äôt have a lot of symptoms can still pass the virus on to others.
